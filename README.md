This is a readme. Most projects have them to explain the details and function of code.

_This_ project is just a mixture of different codebytes. The intention is to learn from and build off of them.

Lets get started. You'll see a few files in the _root directory_ (Folder that contains all the other folders) of the project.
 - `.gitignore` - This file tells Git, your repository, which files to save online and which to leave locally on your computer.
 - `Makefile` - This file contains scripts that automate processes, such as building a file system or database. You can use the given scripts with the `make` command.

All the NodeJS / Backend code will be in the `/node` directory.
