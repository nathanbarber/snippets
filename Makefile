# This file makes it easier to run long chains of commands with a single command
# Look at the say_hi directive. Instead of running each individual command, type 'make say_hi' into your terminal.
# Everything listed will run.
say_hi:
	echo "SAYS - hello"
	echo "SAYS - this would have been harder without 'make'"
	echo "SAYS - I really think 'make is useful"
